# Trading website

## Description
This project is a modern, responsive front-end website for a fictional trading platform, designed to deliver an engaging and user-friendly experience. The platform provides essential information about trading services, offering a smooth navigation experience across multiple sections such as "How It Works", "About", "Getting Started", and "FAQs".  

## Tech Stack
- **HTML** - The structure of the website
- **CSS** - Styling the website, including media queries to make it responsive.
- **JavaScript** - For interactivity (e.g., hamburger menu, slider).  
- **External Libraries**:
  - **LeaderLine** - Drawing lines in the interface (used in `script.js`).

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The site is mobile-friendly, adjusting layout based on screen size using CSS media queries.
- **Interactive Elements**: 
  - A **hamburger menu** for mobile views.
  - A **testimonial slider** to display reviews.
  - An **interactive histogram** for data visualization.
- **Form Submission**: A simple contact form that captures user inputs (name, email, message).

## How to Run the Project Locally
1. **Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder**:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/e1em9nt/projects.git
   cd trading-website
```
2. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
npm install
```
or
```bash
yarn install
```
3. **Open** `index.html` in your browser.

## Known Limitations & Edge Cases  
- **Mobile View**: On smaller devices, there may be some overflow issues with styles in the hamburger menu and question expander.
- **Histogram**: The histogram image is static and does not dynamically update based on user data.

## Potential Improvements  
- **Accessibility**: Add aria labels to improve accessibility for screen readers.
- **SEO Optimization**: Add meta descriptions, alt text for images, and proper heading structure for better search engine optimization.
- **Dynamic Content**: Implement backend services to handle dynamic content, such as the testimonials and histogram data.
- **Form Validation**: Enhance form validation and error handling on the client-side.
