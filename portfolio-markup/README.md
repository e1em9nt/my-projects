# Portfolio Website (Figma Design Implementation)

## Description
This project is a **replica of a portfolio website** created from scratch based on a Figma design. It showcases a fictional software engineer's profile, skills, and completed projects. The website features a modern and responsive design with a dynamic light/dark theme toggle.

**Note**: This is **NOT** my portfolio. It was designed based on someone else's Figma mockup for the purpose of demonstrating front-end web development skills.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML** - Page structure
- **CSS** - Styling
- **JavaScript** - Logic for the theme toggle and other dynamic features

## How to Run the Project Locally
1. **Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder** (or download the project files).
```bash
git clone https://github.com/e1em9nt/projects.git
cd portfolio-markup
```
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser.

## Known Limitations & Improvements  
- **Limited interactivity**: While the website has a theme toggle and showcases static content, there's no interactive features such as a contact form or live updates.
- **SEO optimization**: Currently, SEO features like meta tags and alt text for images are minimal. Improve by adding proper metadata for search engines.
- **Backend Integration**: Incorporate a backend to manage projects dynamically or provide additional functionalities like a blog or news section.
