## Known Limitations & Edge Cases
- **Mobile Navigation**: On small screen sizes (e.g., mobile phones), the navigation menu uses a hamburger icon. However, it is not clickable at the moment, which may prevent users from accessing the navigation menu on mobile devices. This issue can be fixed with additional JavaScript and CSS adjustments.
- **Content Updates**: The program schedule and donation amounts are static. To make them dynamic (e.g., fetching data from a server or API), further backend integration would be needed.

## Possible Improvements
- **Backend Integration**: The donation goal could be dynamically updated using a backend API to reflect real-time contributions.
- **Accessibility**: Improve accessibility features, like adding alt text for all images, ensuring proper contrast, and testing keyboard navigation.
