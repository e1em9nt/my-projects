# Random Quotes Generator

## Description
Random Quotes Generator is a **web application** that fetches and displays a random piece of advice each time the user clicks a button. It uses the [Adviceslip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/advice) to provide quotes and handles errors gracefully, showing a fallback motivational message if the API request fails or there is no internet connection.

The project was designed to be simple and user-friendly, delivering a motivational experience with each quote.
